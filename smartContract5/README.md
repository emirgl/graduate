# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
Smart Contract

yarn
yarn add hardhat --dev
npx hardhat init
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/SupplyChain.js --network fantomtest

Backend
yarn
node main.js
